# Soccer Injury Risk Prediction

Brazil, favourites to win the 2014 FIFA World Cup, saw their prospects diminish following the injuries of star player Neymar. With their subsequent 7-1 loss to Germany, Brazil became a key example of how injuries can alter the outcome of a soccer match and dictate team success. This investigation will attempt to address the complex nature of soccer injuries and predict whether players are at risk of injury using various binary classifications models. We also hope to also discover some of the underlying factors that may or may not contribute to soccer injuries. Ultimately, prediction can provide insight for coaching staff and help in deploying appropriate measures to mitigate injury risk, whether it be by altering their workload or through increased physiotherapy. It can even assist management staff in making more informed decisions when signing new players who are injury prone. Altogether, we hope these insights will result in less injuries suffered amongst a teamâ€™s players and enable them to perform at full strength throughout their season.
